# Yet Another Winnipeg Transit App
An Application designed to give users a easier time getting specific details about bus routes. Scheduled/Estimated times for arrivals and departures along with stops the bus should go to. As well as nearby stops and favorited stops.

# Planned Features
- The ability to see multiple routes and compare arrival and departure times from specific stops
- Potential bus stop rating system (Totally designed as a bit of a joke at the state of Winnipeg Bus Stops)
- Better UI for seeing busses coming to a scheduled stop. (Less ease of mixing up if its late coming in 4 minutes or 4 minutes late.)
- Android builds coming soon
